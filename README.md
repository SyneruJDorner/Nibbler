# Nibbler

## About Nibbler:
  Nibbler is a C++ application based on the game 'Snake' (originated from the 1976 arcade game Blockade). What makes this tricky is that  the game is required to run from 3 different graphics libraries without closing the application to switch between them.
  
## Installation & Execution:
* Run 'source setup.sh' (This will install all dependancies and graphic libraries.)
* Open a New Terminal and run with ./Executable/TEST #num
* #num(number between 0 and 2, each representing a graphic library).
